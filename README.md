"# Fastapi "
practical tips for local development and troubleshooting.

Starting a FastAPI App in main.py
1. Check Your main.py Structure
A typical main.py for FastAPI looks like this:
```python
# Code Generated by Sidekick is for learning and experimentation purposes only.
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

```
2. Start the FastAPI Server with Uvicorn
Uvicorn is the recommended ASGI server for FastAPI. You’ll use it to run your app.
Install Uvicorn (if needed):
Bash# Code Generated by Sidekick is for learning and experimentation purposes only.
pip install uvicorn

Run the Server:
From your project directory (where main.py is located), run:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```


main: Refers to the filename (main.py) without the .py extension.
app: Refers to the FastAPI instance (app = FastAPI()).
--reload: Enables auto-reload for development (restarts server on code changes).


3. Access Your API

By default, the server runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000
Interactive docs available at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (Swagger UI)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc (ReDoc)




Troubleshooting Tips

Module Not Found: Ensure you’re in the directory containing main.py when running the command.
Port in Use: Change the port with --port 8080 (or any other number).
Virtual Environment: Activate your environment before running the server to use the correct dependencies.


Summary

Install Uvicorn:
pip install uvicorn
Run the server:
uvicorn main:app --reload
