To successfully launch a FastAPI application that is defined within a file named `main.py`, follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Verify the Structure of `main.py`:**
     It is crucial to ensure that your `main.py` file adheres to the basic structure required by FastAPI. Open the `main.py` file and confirm that it contains the essential components for a FastAPI application.
    The file should begin by importing the FastAPI class from the fastapi library.
    Then, create an instance of the FastAPI class, typically named `app`.
    Finally, define at least one route using a decorator such as `@app.get("/")`, which specifies the endpoint and the function to be executed when that endpoint is accessed.
    A minimal example of a valid `main.py` structure is shown below:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

2.  **Execute the Application Using Uvicorn:**
   To run the FastAPI application, it's highly recommended to use Uvicorn, a high-performance ASGI server that's well-suited for serving FastAPI applications.
   First, if you haven't already, you will need to install Uvicorn. Open your terminal or command prompt and use the `pip` package installer to install Uvicorn by running the command `pip install uvicorn`. Once the installation is complete, navigate to the project directory containing the `main.py` file in your terminal. Then, execute the command `uvicorn main:app --reload`. This command tells Uvicorn to run the application defined in the `main.py` file, specifically the `app` instance, and the `--reload` flag enables automatic reloading of the server whenever you make changes to your code, which is very convenient during development.
